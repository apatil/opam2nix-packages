# opam2nix is experimental software

I'm hoping to make it stable and a future part of `nixpkgs`. But for now, it's just this code which might work sometimes, and will probably change a lot.

This repository contains prebuilt nix derivations, as well as specific overrides (in `repo/`) for certain packages which require it.

## Building:

    $ ./build.sh

Note that local changes are whatever `git` knows about - this includes uncommitted changes, but does not include new files that haven't been added to `git`.

## Usage:

This repo contains generated `.nix` expressions, as well as some overrides required for a bunch of packages which don't quite work out of the box.

To add packages, add them in `packages.repo` and rebuild.

To include these nix expressions in your own package, you can use the following `opam2nix-packages.nix` file. Fill in the git URLs and revisions with the latest commits (or a commit in your fork, if you need to make a fork).

    { pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {}}:
    with pkgs;
    let
      src = fetchFromGitHub {
        owner = "timbertson"
        repo = "opam2nix-packages";
        rev = "...";
        sha256 = "...";
      };
    
      opam2nixSrc = fetchFromGitHub {
        owner = "timbertson"
        repo = "opam2nix";
        rev = "...";
        sha256 = "...";
      };
    in
    callPackage "${src}/nix" {} { inherit src opam2nixSrc; }

This will import nix/default.nix  from the exact version of the repo that you specified. With this file, you can use it like so:

    opam2nix = import ./opam2nix-packages.nix { inherit pkgs; };

    # for simply building one package, use:
    someOpamPackage = opam2nix.buildPackage "someOpamPackage";

    # for most projects, you'll build selections based on direct dependencies,
    # and include each direct dependency in your `buildInputs`. This will
    # include the `ocaml` dependency:
    buildInputs = opam2nix.build { packages = ["lwt"]; };

As well as `packages`, the `build` function accepts the union of options
accepted by the lower level `selectionsFile` and `importSelectionsFile` functions (see "Configuration" section).

An alternate function `buildPackageSet` is very useful for re-exposing all transitive ocaml dependencies for debugging purposes:

    passThru.ocamlPackages = opam2nix.buildPackageSet { packages = ["lwt"]' };

This can be used with e.g. `nix-build -A ocamlPackages.lwt default.nix` if you need to build an individual dependency (but in your project's configuration; i.e. taking all optional dependencies and constraints into account). It accepts all the same arguments as `build` and produces an object with keys for every transitive dependency, rather than a list of direct dependencies.

## Configuration

 - `opam2nix.selectionsFile` takes an attribute set with the following properties:
    - `ocamlAttr`: defaults to "ocaml"
    - `ocamlVersion`: default is extracted from the derivaiton name of `pkgs.<ocamlAttr>`, should rarely need to be overriden
    - `basePackages`: defaults to `["base-unix" "base-bigarray" "base-threads"]`, which is hacky.
    - `packages`: string list of package names
    - `args`: extra list of string arguments to pass to the `opam2nix` tool (default `[]`)
    - `extraRepos`: extra list of string arguments to pass to the `opam2nix` tool (default `[]`)

 - `opam2nix.importSelectionsFile selections_file` takes an attribute set with the following properties, all optional:
   - `pkgs`
   - `overrides`: function accepting a `world` argument and returning attributes to be overriden / added
   - `opam2nix`
   - `extraPackages`: extra package definitions (obtained by importing the result of `opam2nix generate`. Automatically generated by running `opam2nix generate` on each item in `extraRepos` by default.
   - `extraRepos`: convenient shortcut for populating `extraPackages`, should match the selectionsFile option

# How is the repo generated?

You hopefully don't have to know in order to use this repo - the above instructions should be enough to use these packages without ever delving into the command line utility yourself, but here's how it works:

### Step 1: generate a set of `nix` package definitions based on an opam repository.

    $ opam2nix repo --src ~/.opam/repo/ocaml.org --dest <dest>/nix/packages --cache <dest>/cache '*@latest'

This traverses the repo, scans the packages you've selected, downloads sources that it hasn't cached, reads `opam` files for dependencies, and spits out a `.nix` file for each version of each package.

### Step 2: Implement manual overrides

The above step generates "pure" package definitions based only on the information in the `opam` repository. But in order to integrate cleanly with `nixpkgs`, some generated packages need to be modified. This is implemented as a nix expression which wraps the generated packages. You should probably start with the `repo/default.nix` and `repo/overrides` from the `opam2nix-packages` repo, and make any changes you need from there.

### Step 3: select exact versions of each dependency

The generated `.nix` files are pretty dumb - they know the difference between mandatory and optional dependencies, but that's about all. They rely on you giving them a valid set of dependencies which satisfy all versioning constraints, conflicts, etc. Conveniently, this is exactly what `opam`'s solver does - but instead of actually installing everything, let's just get it to create a `nix` expression of the packages it _would_ install:

    $ opam2nix select \
      --repo <dest>/nix \
      --dest <dest>/selection.nix
      --ocaml-version 4.01.0 \
      --ocaml-attr ocaml \
      --base-packages 'base-unix,base-bigarray,base-threads' \
      lwt

You shouldn't modify this `selections.nix` file directly, as you'll regenerate it whenever your dependencies change.
Instead, you should call it from your main `.nix` file like so:

    { pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {}}:
    let
      selection = pkgs.callPackage ./dest/selection.nix {
        # one day, both of these may be rolled into `nixpkgs`, making them optional:
        opam2nix = pkgs.callPackage /path/to/opam2nix/default.nix {};
        opamPackages = import ./<dest>/nix { inherit pkgs; };
      };
    in
    {
      name = "foo-bar";
      buildInputs = [ selection.lwt ];
      # ...
    }
